NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network user3<28>_IBUF has no load.
WARNING:LIT:395 - The above warning message base_net_load_rule is repeated 274
   more times for the following (max. 5 shown):
   user3<4>_IBUF,
   user3<29>_IBUF,
   user3<5>_IBUF,
   user3<6>_IBUF,
   user3<7>_IBUF
   To see the details of these warning messages, please use the -detail switch.
WARNING:LIT:162 - Only DFS outputs (CLKFX/FX180/CONCUR) of DCM symbol "vclk1"
   are routed, but CLKFB is not routed. Proper phase relationship of output
   clocks to CLKIN cannot be guaranteed.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net vd1/vram_addr_cmp_lt0001 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:772 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp vclk1, consult the device
   Interactive Data Sheet.
